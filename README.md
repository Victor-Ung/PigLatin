# PygLatin
Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add “ay.” So “Python” becomes “ythonpay.” 

The things that this small program does is:                 
Ask the user to input a word.                 
Make sure the user entered a valid word.                  
Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.                             
Display the translation result.
